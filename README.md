# Quake 2 Mod IT266

This is a Pokemon like mod for Quake 2. It was created as the final project for the class IT266 Game Mod Development. 
The plan was to make a mod where you can spawn Pokemon which fight enemies in real time combat.

## Personal Deliverables:

- 10 Pokemon to summon and battle
- Each pokemon should have 4 moves which should be enough unique
- Give commands to the Pokemon, but they should also attack without commands
- Level up and increase stats of Pokemon
- 5 items useable on Pokemon

## Common Deliverables

- Shortcut that Auto-Launches your Mod
- Mod in a Separate Folder
- README file in GIT that explains HOWTO install and play / test your mod
- UI updates reflecting your Personal Deliverables
- Help Screen to detail how to play your mod in game

## Installation Guide

The mod can be found in the quakemon folder. All you have to do is copy the folder to your Quake 2 folder and type "set game quakemon" in the quake console to start the mod.

## Test the mod

Now that you are up and running let us get started! 
- Use the keys 0-9 to switch between your Pokemon and throw the grenade to spawn it.
- Use q to retrieve a pokemon.
- Use e to spawn an enemy.
- Use the keys j and k to switch between the abilities of the Pokemon.
- Use the keys p (potion), l (revive), x (x-attack), u (rarecandy) and i (protect) to use the item on the selected Pokemon.
